Npackd (pronounced "unpacked") is an application store/package manager/marketplace for applications for Windows. It helps you to find and install software, keep your system up-to-date and uninstall it if no longer necessary. You can watch [this short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZkJ2i2xbow) to better understand how it works. The process of installing and uninstalling applications is completely automated (silent or unattended installation and un-installation). There is also a [command line](CommandLine.md) based version of Npackd which you can [install](CommandLineInstallation.md) from the command line:

```
C:\> msiexec.exe /qb- /i http://bit.ly/npackdcl-1_20_5
```
